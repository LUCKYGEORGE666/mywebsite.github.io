#### Project (**main creator and team leader**): Deep insights of activated magnetic hydrochar synthesized via one-pot and two-stage processes for arsenic removal   

**11/2020 – 02/2021**      Prof. **Zhidan Liu’s** research group, E2E, China Agricultural Univ., China.
#### Project (**main creator and team leader**): Arsenic removal via a novel magnetic hydrochar from livestock manure: fabrication, characterization and directed activation
i)	Created and introduced a novel magnetic hydrochar co-activated by thiourea and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles through one-pot synthesis for the first time;
ii)	Systematically characterized the activated hydrochar via EA (element analysis), SEM-EDS, BET study, ICP-OES, XRD, SQUID, XPS, FTIR and Zeta Potential.
iii)	Deeply analyzed the As(V) adsorption capacity through kinetic and isotherm models, where the effects of solution pH and background electrolytes were specifically investigated.
iv)	Discussed the As(V) desorption and reusability of activated hydrochar to achieve comprehensive regeneration.
